# Dogs Gallery

This is a frontend project developed with Next.js 13, React.js, and TypeScript. Users can view an image gallery of dog breeds, choose their favorites ones, and view a gallery of them.

I've also 

* implemented the visual effect and optimization of images, handled image loading errors;
* implemented the possibility to choose and display by sub breeds;
* made use of server-side rendering with React Server Components and client-side fetching with Next.js APIs, to increase initial loading speed and optimize cacheing of data

Styling is enabled by the default stylesheet of create-next-app and react-bootstrap.
