# Dogs Gallery

This is a frontend project developed with Next.js 13, React.js, and TypeScript. Users can view an image gallery of dog breeds, choose their favorites ones, and view a gallery of them.

Users can also

* refresh and see a different set of images of each breeds,
* choose and display by sub breeds.

Implementation highlights:

* Image loading: the visual effect while loading (for better UX), optimization (lazy loading), error handling.
* Server-side rendering with React Server Components && client-side fetching with Next.js APIs.
* Responsive design.
* Styling is enabled by the default stylesheet of create-next-app and react-bootstrap.

# To Run the Project Locally

* Change your `pwd` to this repository and run `npm i`.
* Run `npm run dev`.
* Open your browser at [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/). Note that you must use port 3000, for the local Next.js API service is accessed in the port.
