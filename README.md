# Dogs Gallery

This is a frontend project developed with Next.js 13, React.js, and TypeScript. Users can view an image gallery of dog breeds, choose their favorites ones, and view a gallery of them.

Users can also

* refresh and see a different set of images of each breeds,
* choose and display by sub breeds,

Implementation highlights:

* Image loading: the visual effect while loading (for better UX), optimization (lazy loading), handled errors;
* Server-side rendering with React Server Components and client-side fetching with Next.js APIs, to increase initial loading speed and optimize cacheing of data
* Responsive design
* Styling is enabled by the default stylesheet of create-next-app and react-bootstrap.
